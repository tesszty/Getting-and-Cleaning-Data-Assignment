# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment

Data Source: 
The source data was collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to complete an assignment for a Coursera course named Getting and Cleaning Data instructed by Jeff Leek. 

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

=========================================
The following data files were loaded:

- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

=========================================
The following transformation were made: 
- step1: Load each and every table
- step2: Merge subject_train.txt and y_train.txt, give column names subjectID and activity
- step3: Merge subject_test.txt and y_test.txt. give column names subjectID and activity
- step4: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement from features.txt. Add feature names as column names
- step5: Merge train and test tables  created in step 2 and step 3
- step6: Merge the training and test sets (X_train.txt, X_test.txt). Extract only the measurements from step 4. 
- step7: Merge all the tables into a tidy table. 
- step8: clean up column names

==================================================================
Structure of the final tidy data set:

- SubjectId: 1 to 30 each representing a participant in the study
- activity: the activity that the subject was doing at the time of the measurement

Feature Selection 

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
